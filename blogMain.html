    <img src="blogPics/saiki-k-reawakened.jpg" class="textwrap"><p>I brought in my laptop to the job today, kinda nice having it here with wifi! I was planning to try and be productive but instead spent some time watching a show I used to watch that had a new spin off show. So, I figured this would be a good excuse to practice my HTML and put an image in my blog. It's harder than it looks to figure out the nuances of wrapping text around an image!</p>
    
    
    
	
	<h2>011520.0</h2>
	<p>I've been working for a while now at the gas station. So far it's about as easy as you'd expect, and the coffee, soda, water, slurpees, pizza, 
	and calzones have been a welcome addition to my life for now, though I'm concerned if I'm not careful I'll gain unwanted body fat- it's convinient
	to not have to try as hard to plan ahead for some amount of my food intake. Really, there have been minimal concerns. One of my least favorite things however
	is talking to some of the weirder late night customers who don't want to leave. It's fine though, I just need to think of it as part of the job. My biggest
	concern is that I'll get complacient and not make as much progress in my life, just enjoying the simplicity of the job and sort of being able to relax.

	For some reason, I decided to start trying to design some payroll software in Java. You can quickly see that good payroll software is actuall rather complex.

	<h2>010920.2 day1-part 3</h2>
	<p>I spent some time learning about making money online. 
	I can see how people easily get lost in watching all the videos online trying to make money. 
	One thing I learned is that <a href="http://www.clickbank.com" target="_blank">ClickBank</a> 
	is a website where you can make a comission helping other companies do their advertisements. I'm still learning a bit about how it works, but it's pretty interesting stuff!

	<h2>010920.1: day1-part 2</h2>
	<p>nav bar is up and working, easier than I remember. Behold the power of simple websites.</p>
	
	<h2>010920.0: day1- part 1</h2>
	<p>Today I'm trying to remind myself how to make websites.
	It's not so bad, but the biggest challange is that things are so differnt and they 
	don't seem to make it as easy just to do things like upload .html files to the web 
	in folders and just let you do your thing. It's all templates and crap now.</P>
