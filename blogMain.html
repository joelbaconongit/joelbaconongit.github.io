    <h2>012320.0</h2>
    <h3>small victories:</h3><p>Today I got the website up and running, live online, hosted with github pages. I'm not sure if I should be proud or embarassed that someone might go to my website!<br> The process was supposed to be easy and when it didin't initially work it suddenly seemed way more complicated than it was, and I still can't figure out what the original issue was.<br> I originally posted it on an already existing github account that had another already existing website repository that I had just put up there when I was playing around in git. I'm not sure if for some reason this is involved with the conflict- you can only host one website repo on GitHub pages... so to test out my theorey that this conflict was somehow related to the problem out, I just made a fresh github account and this one seems to have no problems even thought I did just about everything else exactly the same. I'm being a bit lazy and just making my commits and pushes to github via <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a>, but hey, for now it's easier than messing around in GitBash. I'm sure I'll get quicker with get later, but at least I understand what I'm trying to do and have some way of making it work for now. As a side effect of working on the website and hosting it via GitHub, I've got good version control and also I can edit my pages anywhere- even on a phone or tablet if I'm so inclined.<br>For now, I haven't decided what software to use, on a long term basis for things like html, css, js...  but I'm not particularly disliking Brackets 1.14.1, since everythign I've tried to do in it thus far worked as expected.</p>
    <h3>concerns:</h3>
      <p>As my next divorce thing gets closer, I'm worried that I'm going to screw something up with that and make my life worse. I really hope to be done with all of that stuff soon so I can have more of my focus for working on things that I want to do!</p>

    <img src="blogPics/saiki-k-reawakened.jpg" class="textwrap"><p>I brought in my laptop to the job today, kinda nice having it here with wifi! I was planning to try and be productive but instead spent some time watching a show I used to watch that had a new spin off show. So, I figured this would be a good excuse to practice my HTML and put an image in my blog. It's harder than it looks to figure out the nuances of wrapping text around an image!</p>
    
    
    
	
	<h2>011520.0</h2>
	<p>I've been working for a while now at the gas station. So far it's about as easy as you'd expect, and the coffee, soda, water, slurpees, pizza, 
	and calzones have been a welcome addition to my life for now, though I'm concerned if I'm not careful I'll gain unwanted body fat- it's convinient
	to not have to try as hard to plan ahead for some amount of my food intake. Really, there have been minimal concerns. One of my least favorite things however
	is talking to some of the weirder late night customers who don't want to leave. It's fine though, I just need to think of it as part of the job. My biggest
	concern is that I'll get complacient and not make as much progress in my life, just enjoying the simplicity of the job and sort of being able to relax. 
	<br>
	For some reason, I decided to start trying to design some payroll software in Java. You can quickly see that good payroll software is actually rather complex.

	<h2>010920.2 day1-part 3</h2>
	<p>I spent some time learning about making money online. 
	I can see how people easily get lost in watching all the videos online trying to make money. 
	One thing I learned is that <a href="http://www.clickbank.com" target="_blank">ClickBank</a> 
	is a website where you can make a comission helping other companies do their advertisements. I'm still learning a bit about how it works, but it's pretty interesting stuff!

	<h2>010920.1: day1-part 2</h2>
	<p>nav bar is up and working, easier than I remember. Behold the power of simple websites.</p>
	
	<h2>010920.0: day1- part 1</h2>
	<p>Today I'm trying to remind myself how to make websites.
	It's not so bad, but the biggest challange is that things are so differnt and they 
	don't seem to make it as easy just to do things like upload .html files to the web 
	in folders and just let you do your thing. It's all templates and crap now.</P>
