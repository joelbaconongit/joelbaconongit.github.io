today I am like a newbie programmer but I just started using GitHub again so there's some familiarity.
I don't know what all of my old stuff is on here or why I have it but I'm probably going to delete it all.
as to where I should start or what I should do or why that is a good question but I feel like I should put my skills to better use than I have been lately...
I think I can just say this as a.txt file but I'm not really sure because I have not worked in GitHub in that long so I really know very little at this point... already it is strange that there are different colors in the words. although I know that is useful for variety of things I'm not sure why it's happening right now. 
it seems like the apostrophe is somehow involved and so are certain keywords like for
you can select spaces or tabs which reminds me a lot of silicon valley the show. 
yay.
